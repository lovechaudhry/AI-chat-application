 AI-Powered PDF Knowledge Base Chatbot This project is an AI-powered chatbot application designed to answer user queries based on the content of uploaded PDF files. It combines a user-friendly chat interface with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver accurate and context-aware responses derived directly from the uploaded documents.  Features AI Chat Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions about the uploaded PDFs. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the documents and generates responses in real-time.  PDF Upload & Processing: Users can upload one or more PDFs, which serve as the knowledge base for the chatbot. The system processes these files and indexes their contents for efficient retrieval.  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances response quality by using document retrieval techniques to fetch relevant text passages, combined with generative AI to produce coherent and precise answers.  Large Language Model Integration: Uses open-source LLMs through Hugging Face, Gro, or other compatible APIs to handle language understanding and response generation.  Streamlit Interface: A simple, interactive UI built with Streamlit for seamless user experience.  API Access: Offers an API endpoint to handle user queries, ideal for integrating the chatbot functionality into other applications or systems.  Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests ensure the robustness and reliability of all major functionalities.
